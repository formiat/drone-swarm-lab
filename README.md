# Swarm Coordination Runtime

Swarm Coordination Runtime is a Rust workspace for mission-level coordination of autonomous drone fleets. The current code focuses on deterministic simulation, task ownership, heartbeat-based membership, failure detection, and measurable recovery behaviour rather than low-level flight control.

This is a **research prototype**, not a production flight-control system.

## Quick Start (Golden Path)

### 1. Clone and test

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd drone
cargo test --workspace
```

Expected: 250+ tests pass in ~15 seconds.

### 2. Run smoke benchmark

```bash
cargo run -p swarm-examples --bin strategy_comparison -- \
  --smoke --mission coverage --output-dir results/coverage_smoke/
```

Expected: `results/coverage_smoke/` created with `results.json`, `results.csv`, `table.md`, `manifest.json`.

### 3. Run scenario suite

```bash
cargo run -p swarm-examples --bin strategy_comparison -- \
  --scenario-suite scenarios/coverage.safety.json --output-dir results/safety_smoke/
```

### 4. Create benchmark pack with report

```bash
cargo run -p swarm-examples --bin strategy_comparison -- \
  --quick --mission sar --output-dir results/sar_quick/ --report results/sar_quick/report.md
```

### 5. Inspect replay

```bash
# Generate replay log
cargo run -p swarm-examples --bin strategy_comparison -- \
  --smoke --mission coverage --replay-log results/replay/

# Inspect summary
cargo run --bin replay -- --log results/replay/*.json --summary

# ASCII snapshot at tick 50
cargo run --bin replay -- --log results/replay/*.json --tick 50
```

### 6. Run mock SITL

```bash
cargo run --bin sitl_agent -- \
  --mock --scenario scenarios/sitl.waypoints.json --agent-id agent-0
```

## Current Status

| Feature | Status | Since | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Benchmark (smoke/quick/full) | ✅ Stable | M21 | `--output-dir`, `--report`, `BenchmarkManifest` |
| Mission DSL | ✅ Stable | M19 | `schema_version: "0.1"`, validation API |
| Safety Layer | ✅ Stable | M20 | `SafetyAllocator` wrapper, no-fly/geofence/separation |
| SAR v2 | ✅ Stable | M14 | `BeliefMap`, sensor noise, confirmation scans |
| CBBA Robustness | ✅ Stable | M15 | Convergence metrics, TSP ordering, retransmission |
| Infrastructure Inspection | ✅ Stable | M16 | Edge coverage, route efficiency |
| Mock SITL | ✅ Stable | M20 | `sitl_agent --mock`, no external deps |
| Replay / Debuggability | ✅ Stable | M23 | `replay` CLI, ASCII visualization |
| Real PX4 | 🧪 Experimental | M20 | Feature-gated, requires PX4 SITL setup |

**Test coverage:** 250+ tests, 10 crates, 12 JSON scenarios.

## Known Limitations

1. **Simulation only:** No real hardware integration beyond experimental PX4 SITL scaffold.
2. **Single-agent SITL:** Multi-agent SITL not yet supported.
3. **2D world:** All scenarios operate in 2D (x, y) with fixed altitude.
4. **Deterministic RNG:** Scenarios use seeded RNG; real-world noise is not modeled.
5. **Simplified kinematics:** Battery drain is proportional to distance, not accounting for hover/climb.

See [Strategy Support Matrix](#strategy-support-matrix) for per-strategy known limitations.

## Strategy Support Matrix

| Mission | Strategy | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| coverage | all | stable | All strategies produce success_rate > 0.9 on ideal/standard profiles |
| sar | greedy, auction, connectivity-aware | stable | — |
| sar | cbba | unsupported | CBBA re-convergence delay after `release_task()` exceeds `max_unassigned_ticks`; fix scoped to M27 |
| sar | centralized | unsupported | Static pre-planning incompatible with SAR dynamic task release; agents revisit stale cell assignments |
| inspection (linear/random) | all | stable | — |
| inspection (perimeter) | greedy, auction, connectivity-aware | experimental | Battery/time constraint limits coverage; success rate ~0–0.4 |
| inspection (perimeter) | centralized | experimental | Static plan; moderate coverage |
| inspection (perimeter) | cbba | experimental | Allocation gap (`max_bundle_size`); bundle-slot fix (M26) improves coverage |

**Status meanings:**
- **stable** — success_rate > 0 across standard seeds; suitable for benchmarking.
- **experimental** — works but constrained by battery/time or algorithmic limits; use with awareness.
- **unsupported** — consistently 0% success due to a known root cause; tracked for future milestones.

## Non-Goals

- **Not a production flight-control system.** This is a research prototype for coordination algorithms.
- **Not a certified safety layer.** Safety constraints are checked but not formally verified.
- **Not ready for real-world swarm flights.** Simulation-only with experimental SITL scaffold.
- **Not a MAVLink ground control station.** PX4 integration is experimental and minimal.
